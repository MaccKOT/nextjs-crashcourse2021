This is a [Next.js Crash Course 2021](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Build and run

Make build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Live server for production build (static files in 'out' folder):

```bash
npm run serve
```

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/articles](http://localhost:3000/api/articles). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/articles/index.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
